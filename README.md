# Mambo_No_5
Exploring the demographics contained with the 1999 Lou Bega hit, "Mambo No. 5"

## Abstract
Mambo No. 5 was released on April 19th, 1999, gaining popularity in the U.S. and Europe. The goal of this project is to collect, manipulate, and analyze the names given in the song. Various questions will be posed, these include:

* Upon release, what was the average age of woman Mr. Bega references?
* How many women felt "called out" in the song?
* 

## Assumptions
### Location
U.S demographic data. This might raise some contention, as Mr. Bega is a German rapper. 
*(TODO: Justify this)*

### Ages
All women are of age (i.e. born strictly before 1981). Birth data is categorized by year, song released mid-April. (Mr. Bega was 24 years old when Mambo No. 5 was released.) 

Evidence he's not a scoundrel:
  He does not "want some gin and juice" like his friends

### Names
* Names given exactly are (cite lyricgenius):
```
["Angela", "Pamela", "Sandra", "Rita", "Monica", "Erica", "Tina", "Mary", "Jessica"]
```

* Problem of phonetic vs. text: 
`["Erika", "Monika"]`

* Tina problem: 
`["Christina", "Christine", "Kristina", "Kristine"]
opens can of worms for Rita usually being short for Margarita, or Sandra for Cassandra
