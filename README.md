# Mambo_No_5
Exploring the demographics contained with the 1999 Lou Bega hit, "Mambo No. 5"

## Abstract
Mambo No. 5 was released on April 19th, 1999, gaining popularity in the U.S. and Europe. The goal of this project is to collect, manipulate, and analyze the names given in the song. Various questions will be posed, these include:

* How many women felt "called out" in the song?
* What was the average age of woman Mr. Bega references when...
  * When the song was released?
  * When the song was inspired in Miami (find year)
* How much better could Mr. Bega do?
  * (required) Same number of names
  * (optional) Names chosen must fit syllabic structure

## Assumptions

### Time Frames

Mr. Bega was originally inspired to write the song during a trip to Miami when he was 18. This places the conception in 1993.

The song was released on April 19th, 1999.

### Location
U.S demographic data from the SSA. Mr. Bega is a German artist, but he has said he was inspired to cover a mambo song during his trip to Miami.

### Ages
All women are of age (i.e. born strictly before 1981 when using 1999). Birth data is categorized by year, song released mid-April. (Mr. Bega was 24 years old when Mambo No. 5 was released.) 

Justification: Mr. Bega is not a scoundrel, this is evident when he sings he does not "want some gin and juice" like his friends

### Names
* Names given exactly are (cite lyricgenius):
```
["Angela", "Pamela", "Sandra", "Rita", "Monica", "Erica", "Tina", "Mary", "Jessica"]

# Syllables
[3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,3]
```

* Problem of phonetic vs. text: 
`["Erika", "Monika"]`

* Tina problem: 
`["Christina", "Christine", "Kristina", "Kristine"]` but this opens a potential can of worms where Rita is usually short for Margarita, and Sandra for Cassandra
